      we declared our paradigm of corporate management as a socially responsible
      management, and with our fundamental philosophy in contributing to
      economic growth through active hiring of our employees and growth of our
      businesses, we pledge to do our best in conducting transparent and honest
      management according to laws and conscience, making social contributions
      together by all of us working at Emart, achieving mutual growth with our
      partner companies, and executing and delivering eco-friendly management
